1. What is microservice?
 - It is a software architectural style where application is divided into smaller pieces of loosely coupled deployable services
 - Separation of concerns 
 - Single responsibility where they interact through API 
 - Different techstack for each services

2. What is Monolith architecture?
 - All the services are under the application like UI , DB, Auth, API etc
 - Even for smaller changes, we need to build and deploy the whole application

3. Difference between both?
 - Same as above answer

4.Why do we need useEffect()?

 - In case you need to make an external call after the initial render, we can use this hook to make that call 
 - Manage side effects ie. operations that occur after the inital render

5. What is optional chaining?

 JS 
 - Expression produces a value

8. CORS?
 - cross origin resource sharing
 - When different origins try to access the api, browser makes a call before the actual api call to the server

 - For simple requests no preflight req is made

9. async and await?
 - It is a JS function that is used for handling Promises asynchronously
 - Typically used for data fetching operation where the returned data gives a promise

10. why const json = await response.json()? 
 - The response data is in JSON format. We need to parse it to JS object before using the data
