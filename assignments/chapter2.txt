1. What is `NPM`?
 - Package manager to manage all the packages. It is a repo where all the packages are hosted.
2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
 - It is a bundler, necessary to bundle the app before production. It minifies code, optimize code & image, code splitting, chunking and more
3. What is `.parcel-cache`?
 - Fast builds. 
4. What is `npx` ?
 - It executes the packages
5. What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
 - dep is for production, devDep for development purpose. parcel(bundler) is for devDep as we need to push code efficiently for production
6. What is Tree Shaking?
 - Removes unused code 
7. What is Hot Module Replacement?

9. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?
 - package.json has packages that can be allowed to have minor updates. .lock files have the exact versioning of packages
10. What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
 - No, they are set of packages created with the package and package.lock configs. 
 - We should never push to git if you can regenerate files.
 - It is transitive dependencies, where a package depends on another package
11. What is the `dist` folder?
 - when we run npx parcel build index.html, it saves the output in dist folder
 - contains production ready code in this folder
 - actual output of the code is run from dist folder, and during Hot reload it uses parcel-cache folder to check for changes
12. What is `browserlists`
