1.Is JSX mandatory for React?
 - No, we can write react code even without using react but JSX makes it really easy for developers
2.Is ES6 mandatory for React?
 - No, but highly recommended for structuring modular code
3.How can I write comments in JSX?

4. What is Virtual DOM?
 - Representation of actual dom. It is basically Objects with nested objects. 
 - comparison is made in Virtual dom even before accessing actual dom that is why react is faster
5. What is Reconciliation in React?
 - React uses this algorithm to determine how to efficiently update actual dom
 - when state changes, react initiates recon. process to determine which parts needs to update
 - goal is to update quickly and efficiently
6.What is React Fiber?
 - Introduced in React16
 - Improve recon. algorithm
 - Concurrent rendering 
 - Suspense
7.Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
 - To efficiently update dom, keys are important 
 - used when you use dynamic data like mapping through elements
 - use only unique values as keys
8.What is a Config Driven UI ?
 - Approach where UI components are determined by backend data rather than hardcore data
